# Array problems

 ***1. Longest consecutive subsequence***
 ###
Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
* Input: <br />
The first line of input contains T, number of test cases. First line of line each test case contains a single integer N.
Next line contains N integer array.
* Output: <br />
Print the output of each test case in a seprate line.
* Constraints: <br />
1 <= T <= 100 <br />
1 <= N <= 105 <br />
0 <= a[i] <= 105 <br />
* Example: <br />
Input: <br />
2 <br />
7 <br />
2 6 1 9 4 5 3 <br />
7 <br />
1 9 3 10 4 20 2 <br />

* Output: <br />
6 <br />
4 <br />


***2. Subarray with given sum***
###
Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
* Input: <br />
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case is N and S, where N is the size of array and S is the sum. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the array elements.
* Output: <br />
For each testcase, in a new line, print the starting and ending positions(1 indexing) of first such occuring subarray from the left if sum equals to subarray, else print -1.
* Constraints: <br />
1 <= T <= 100 <br />
1 <= N <= 107 <br />
1 <= Ai <= 1010 <br />
* Example: <br />
* Input <br/>
2<br/>
5 12<br/>
1 2 3 7 5<br/>
10 15<br/>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>
* Output: <br />
2 4<br />
1 5<br />
* Explanation : <br />
Testcase1: sum of elements from 2nd position to 4th position is 12<br />
Testcase2: sum of elements from 1st position to 5th position is 15
