 ***1. Longest consecutive subsequence***
 ###
Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
* Input: <br />
The first line of input contains T, number of test cases. First line of line each test case contains a single integer N.
Next line contains N integer array.

* Output: <br />
Print the output of each test case in a seprate line.

* Constraints: <br />
1 <= T <= 100 <br />
1 <= N <= 105 <br />
0 <= a[i] <= 105 <br />

* Example: <br />
Input:
2 <br />
7 <br />
2 6 1 9 4 5 3 <br />
